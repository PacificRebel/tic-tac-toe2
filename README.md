# Tic-tac-toe2

##React app built without create-react-app  
- babel and webpack installed separately and  
folder structure built from scratch.  
Good exercise!  
(currently an issue with where the app starts  
  from - see workaround in package.json:  
  "start": "./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js")
